# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

Purpose: Help a chief data scientist analyze data on student funding and standardized test scores. My tasks are to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. However, there's evidence of academic dishonesty and the analysis was re-analyzed with some data removed.

## Results

- Total students
  
    - was 39,170 is now 38,709.
    
- Total budget

  - the total budget stayed the same at $24,649,428
  
- Average math score

  - the average math score stayed the same at 79
  
- Average reading score

  - was 81.8 is now 81.9
  
- Passing math percentage

  - was 74.9% now is 74.8%
  
- Passing reading percentage

  - was 85.8% is now 85.7%
  
- Overall passing percentage

  - was 65.1% is now 64.9%
  
In depth analysis:

Top 5 and bottom performing schools based on overall passing rate.

## Summary

After having the data re-analyzed I realized four major differences in the analysis.

1. The total amount of students in all the schools changed from 39,170 to 38,709.
2. Thomas High School passing overall percentage changed from 90.9% to 90.6%
3. Thomas High School passing percentage in math changed from 93.3% to 93.2%
4. Thomas High School passing percentage in reading changed from 97.3% to 97.02%

Since the solution to having evidence of academic dishonesty was to remove all 9th graders from Thomas High School, the real effects will show in the schools internal performance overall.
